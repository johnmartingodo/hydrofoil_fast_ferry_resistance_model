# hydrofoil_fast_ferry_resistance_model
Digital resources for the paper entitled "A Resistance Model for Hydrofoil 
Fast Ferries", by John Martin Kleven Godø, Sverre Steen, and Odd Magnus 
Faltinsen.

## Usage
The data directory contains subdirectories for resistance and weight results 
for the hydrofoil systems presented in the paper. A DataExtractor class can 
be found in the data_extraction.py file. Furthermore, the 
data_extraction_test.ipynb notebook presents an example of how to extract and 
interpolate in the presented datasets.
